## ABOUT
**push_swap** is a sorting algorithm project for arranging numbers in ascending order using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement the most efficient sorting algorithm with the least number of operations.



## HOW TO USE
#### 1Âº - Clone the repository
```git
git clone git@github.com:koraymullaoglu/push_swap.git
```

#### 2Âº - Enter the project folder
```bash
cd push_swap
make
```

#### MAKEFILE RULES

`make` or `make all` - Compile pipex files.

`make clean` - Delete all .o (object files) files.

`make fclean` - Delete all .o (object files) and .a (executable) files.

`make re` - Use rules `fclean` + `all`.

## MANDATORY
> There are two stacks, a and b (where stack a contains unsorted numbers, and stack b is initially empty).
- The task is to sort the elements in stack a using the minimum number of pushswap actions.
- The actions performed should be printed to the terminal.



## NORMINETTE
> At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written following the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school.

```
- No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators, or variable-length arrays allowed;
- Each function must be a maximum of 25 lines, not counting the function's curly brackets;
- Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, with comments included;
- A function can take 4 named parameters maximum;
- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static);
- You can't declare more than 5 variables per function;
- ...
